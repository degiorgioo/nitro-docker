# Project Git Hooks

Git hooks in this directory will be installed with:

    gulp sync-githooks

This command is executed on every yarn install.  
Every file in this directory will be installed in the git hooks directory (`.git/hooks/`) if:

* the git hooks directory exists and we are in the root of the git repository
* the filename is a valid hook name
* there is not an existing user hook (hooks installed with this script will be replaced with the current version)

Removing a git hook from this directory will uninstall the corresponding git hook with the next `gulp sync-githooks`.
